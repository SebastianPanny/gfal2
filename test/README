Make sure that all the test scripts in this directory and in all the 
subdirectories (*.sh) has executable flag.

The "execute_tests.sh" script executes the whole test suite (unit and regression
tests). The unit tests are self-contained (should not depend on the development
environment), however, the regression tests require external dependencies:
endpoints, servers, etc. The default configuration enables running the tests
in a standard CERN development environemnt. If you develop in a different 
environment, you may need to edit some variables. Usually, the external 
dependencies are marked clearly, you should not change anything than those.

Some rules:

- The "execute_tests.sh" scripts execute a whole test suite in the contained 
directory and its subdirectories. For instance, test/unit/execute_tests.sh
executes the unit tests only, test/regression/execute_tests.sh execute the
regression tests only, test/execute_tests.sh executes both unit and regression
tests. 
- Execute the scripts from the directory where they are.
- The tests in the subdirectories are self-contained, they do not depend on 
settings from the upper directories to enable selective test execution.
- For the settings, see the README files in each subdirectories. If you have a 
different environment, you may need to tailor the whole the test suite, 
according to the separate instructions in the README files. So, if you encounter
trouble, read them all.
- Ensure that you have valid credentials for the external resources.
