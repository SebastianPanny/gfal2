\paragraph*{1. Why switch to GFAL 2.0 ? }

10 good reasons to switch to GFAL 2.0 : \par
 GFAL 2.0 :\begin{itemize}
\item is {\bf extensible} with the new plugin system. Any protocol can be supported with a plugin.\item is independant of the technologies provided ( {\bf no} {\bf globus} {\bf dependencies}, no need to install technologies that are not used ).\item is now {\bf thread-safe}.\item has a new error's system with full string errors and a \char`\"{}TRACE\char`\"{} mode.\item is now designed to be as POSIX as possible, No non-posix like functions will be provided in the future.\item manages the extended attributes system for advanced functions.\item is smaller and faster\item has an integrated cache system.\item is given with {\bf gfal\-FS} , a NEW file system which can mount any point in the GRID like a local folder.\item is fully supported and easy to install on EMI.\end{itemize}


\paragraph*{1. What are the main changes from gfal 1.0 ? }

\begin{itemize}
\item the NON-POSIX functions of 1.0 do not exist anymore, they are mapped to POSIX one.\item the gfal\_\-request system is now replaced by a more simpler one.\item GFal 2.0 provide the getxattr, setxattr, listxattr calls for the plateform's specific calls ( turl resolution, guid resolution, ...)\end{itemize}


\paragraph*{2. I would make a SRM to TURL resolution with GFAL 2.0 and the gfal\_\-srm\_\-plugin, How to do it ? }

\begin{itemize}
\item char turl[2048];\item gfal\_\-getxattr(\char`\"{}srm://masrul/monfichier\char`\"{}, \char`\"{}user.replicas\char`\"{}, turl, 2048);\end{itemize}


\paragraph*{3. I would make a GUID to LFC resolution with GFAL 2.0 and the gfal\_\-lfc\_\-plugin, How to do it ? }

\begin{itemize}
\item char lfn[2048];\item gfal\_\-getxattr(\char`\"{}srm://masrul/monfichier\char`\"{}, \char`\"{}user.guid\char`\"{}, lfn, 2048);\end{itemize}


\paragraph*{4. I want a more verbose error report, How to do it ? }

\begin{itemize}
\item \doxyref{gfal\_\-set\_\-verbose}{p.}{group__posix__group_g331e181c2fadd801321ad43033835052}( GFAL\_\-VERBOSE\_\-DEBUG $|$ GFAL\_\-VERBOSE\_\-VERBOSE );\item [...]\item \doxyref{gfal\_\-posix\_\-check\_\-error()}{p.}{gfal__posix__ng_8c_57ced6eae7afd2d0413988da02fe0373}; // called after each gfal\_\-$\ast$ call\end{itemize}


\paragraph*{4. I need to create a GFAL 2.0 plugin, How to do it ? }

\begin{itemize}
\item a tutorial will come for more details.\end{itemize}


\paragraph*{5 . I need to implement a specific non-POSIX call in GFAL, How to do it ? }

\begin{itemize}
\item create a new xattr's key for your needs.\end{itemize}


\paragraph*{6. What about the licence ? : }

\begin{itemize}
\item The license is still unchanged from gfal 1.0, It is a Apache 2.0 license : \doxyref{apl}{p.}{apl}\end{itemize}


\paragraph*{7. I get a Communication Error ( ECOMM ) on all my gfal Calls : }

\begin{itemize}
\item ECOMM means an un-usual Error, reported by the server-side. In Most of the case, this error is due to an access right problem. try to setup your voms-proxy with voms-prox-init --voms [your vo] and try again.\end{itemize}


\paragraph*{8. I Wish add/remove a plugin to the plugin list, How to do it ? }

\begin{itemize}
\item The list of the gfal's plugin loaded is in the environment variable GFAL\_\-PLUGIN\_\-LIST, you have just to modify this environment variable before start your gfal's program. \end{itemize}
